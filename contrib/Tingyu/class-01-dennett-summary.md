What other aspects to broaden the scope of my reflection?

In an increasingly digital world, the rise of AI-generated fake people presents a profound threat to human autonomy and democratic integrity. These artificial entities, designed to deceive, not only undermine individual decision-making but also erode societal trust. I have always believed that AI-generated fakes, by their very nature, not only deceive individuals but also erode human agency.

This aligns with Immanuel Kant’s notion of the "categorical imperative," which holds that treating people as ends in themselves is a fundamental ethical principle. In contrast, AI-generated fakes treat humans as mere means to an end, fundamentally undermining this principle. When AI fakes treat humans as tools for manipulation, this degrades the social fabric built on mutual respect and trust. Without adherence to such principles, society risks becoming fragmented, with citizens losing trust in both interpersonal relationships and the institutions that govern them.

Building on this, Dennett argues that AI-generated fake people pose a broader societal threat by eroding human freedom, disrupting democracies, and manipulating people’s beliefs. The responsibility and credibility of representatives from economically and politically powerful entities—corporations and governments—will diminish if no human is held accountable for the harm inflicted on the rights of the governed.

The danger of AI-generated fakes is already apparent. In recent years, deepfake videos have surfaced, with political figures shown to say or do things they never actually did, sowing confusion and distrust. For example, in 2020, a deepfake of the Belgian prime minister falsely linking climate change to the COVID-19 pandemic spread widely, shaking public confidence. These cases illustrate how AI-generated content has the potential to undermine entire economies and democratic processes, making the stakes far higher than just individual deception.

Given the severe consequences AI-generated fakes can have on public trust, governments must step in to mitigate these risks. Just as parents are responsible for the actions of their children, governments must take accountability for regulating AI-generated fakes, ensuring that victims are protected and bad actors are punished. Failure to act will not only diminish public trust but also leave citizens vulnerable to large-scale disinformation campaigns and cyber manipulation.

One practical step that governments can take is adopting Dennett's proposed watermark-like solution, which would allow people to easily identify AI-generated content. Governments must take the lead in setting international standards and ensuring compliance across borders. While global cooperation is challenging, successful models like the Paris Agreement on climate change show that international collaboration on global threats is possible. An international body overseeing AI compliance could help foster this cooperation.

Beyond regulation, governments must invest in public education campaigns to help citizens recognize AI-generated content. Raising awareness and improving digital literacy will empowedr individuals with the tools they need to protect themselves from deception, making it harder for AI fakes to manipulate public opinion.

In a world where public trust in institutions, media, and personal relationships is already fragile, the unchecked rise of AI-generated fake people threatens to accelerate this decline. The time to act is now. Without decisive global regulations and ethical standards, we risk losing not only our digital integrity but the very foundations of democracy and human autonomy itself.
