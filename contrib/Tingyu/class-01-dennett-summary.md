Reaction to Dennett Article (Commit 2)
ChatGPT Request 1: 
Here is my initial thought after reading the article "The Problem With Counterfeit People". Upon reading it, adding what details that can make my composition more complete?

I have always thought that AI-generated fake people not only deceive individuals but also erode human agency. If people increasingly interact with AI without knowing it, their ability to make informed decisions diminishes, leading to a loss of autonomy. Immanuel Kant’s notion of the "categorical imperative," where treating people as ends in themselves is a fundamental ethical principle. In contrast, AI fakes treat humans as mere means to an end, undermining this principle.

I also agree with Dennett that AI-generated fake people could erode human freedom, disrupt democracies by spreading misinformation, and manipulate people's beliefs and actions. The responsibility and credibility of representatives from the most economically and politically powerful entities—corporations and governments—will diminish if no human being is held accountable for the harm done to the rights and freedoms of the governed. For instance, in recent years, deepfake videos have surfaced where political figures appear to say or do things they never did, potentially destabilizing public trust. In 2020, a deepfake of the Belgian prime minister falsely linking climate change to the COVID-19 pandemic circulated widely. This is an early example of how AI-generated content can be weaponized to manipulate public perception.

To address this issue, governments must assume responsibility for the consequences of digital fakes, including compensating victims and enforcing strict regulations. If they fail to do so, society will lose trust in all forms of representation. This situation is analogous to parents being held accountable for the crimes of juveniles—if the "children" (in this case, fake people) cannot be held responsible, then someone must be punished and take control of the situation.

In this regard, Dennett’s call for a watermark-like solution to identify AI-generated people is especially urgent. I believe governments should take the lead in setting standards and ensuring compliance across borders. However, collaboration presents significant challenges. Will this responsibility fall to national governments, international coalitions, or perhaps a newly created global regulatory body? Whatever form this oversight takes, it must possess both the authority and technical expertise to enforce regulations—a difficult task given the competing interests of powerful nations and corporations. Global cooperation, while essential, has historically proven difficult to achieve on issues like data privacy. Similar challenges will likely arise when attempting to regulate AI on a global scale.

In a world where trust in institutions, media, and even personal relationships is already under strain, the unchecked development of AI could accelerate this decline. Conversely, strong regulations and safeguards could help restore and preserve trust in an increasingly digital world.
