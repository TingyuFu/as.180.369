I have always thought that AI-generated fake people not only deceive individuals but also erode human agency. If people increasingly interact with AI without knowing it, their ability to make informed decisions diminishes, leading to a loss of autonomy. This aligns with Immanuel Kant’s notion of the "categorical imperative," which holds that treating people as ends in themselves is a fundamental ethical principle. In contrast, AI-generated fakes treat humans as mere means to an end, fundamentally undermining this principle.

Building on this, Dennett argues that AI-generated fake people not only violate ethical principles but also pose a broader societal threat by eroding human freedom, disrupting democracies, and manipulating people’s beliefs and actions. The responsibility and credibility of representatives from the most economically and politically powerful entities—corporations and governments—will diminish if no human being is held accountable for the harm inflicted on the rights and freedoms of the governed. For instance, in recent years, deepfake videos have surfaced where political figures appear to say or do things they never did, potentially destabilizing public trust. In 2020, a deepfake of the Belgian prime minister falsely linking climate change to the COVID-19 pandemic circulated widely. This example shows how AI-generated content can sow confusion and fuel misinformation, making it difficult for citizens to trust political figures and the information they receive, which in turn weakens democratic processes.

Given the severe consequences that AI-generated fakes can have on public trust and democratic systems, it is crucial that governments step in to mitigate these risks. Governments must assume responsibility for the consequences of digital fakes, including compensating victims and enforcing strict regulations. If they fail to do so, society will lose trust in all forms of representation. This situation is analogous to parents being held accountable for the crimes of juveniles—if the "children" (in this case, fake people) cannot be held responsible, then someone must be punished and take control of the situation.

One practical step that governments can take in their role as regulators is adopting Dennett's proposed watermark-like solution, which would allow people to easily identify AI-generated content. I believe governments should take the lead in setting international standards and ensuring compliance across borders. However, this presents significant challenges. Will this responsibility fall to national governments, international coalitions, or perhaps a newly created global regulatory body? Whatever form this oversight takes, it must possess both the authority and technical expertise to enforce regulations—a difficult task given the competing interests of powerful nations and corporations. Global cooperation, while essential, has historically proven difficult to achieve on issues like data privacy. Similar challenges will likely arise when attempting to regulate AI on a global scale.

In a world where public trust in institutions, media, and even personal relationships is already under strain, the unchecked rise of AI-generated fake people threatens to accelerate this decline. However, with strong regulations and safeguards grounded in ethical responsibility and international cooperation, trust can be restored and preserved in an increasingly digital world.
