Reaction to Dennett Article 
-- The Problem With Counterfeit People
Government and society are founded on the consensus of the people. Fiat money holds value beyond mere paper when issued by a trustworthy government. Similarly, the social contract remains reliable when both governors and the governed act responsibly. Therefore, I agree with Dennett that counterfeit money and counterfeit people represent serious crimes, as they undermine the trust essential to a functioning society.
